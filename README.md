To run the code, you have to make a contract with Lifbi to get access to the NEPS SC1 data. The data files need to be put in src/original_data. The NEPS' datasets come as .dta files that need to be converted to .csv to run my code. This is taken care of by running the script src/data_cleaning/convert_csv.R.
Afterwards, first run the scripts in src/data_cleaning before you can run the scripts in src/analysis.
