Data used in this study is drawn from the... check NEPS-Website what to write here (panel, early childhood development, early on, (non) cognitive skill measures). I do not exploit the panel dimension and use it as a cross section. SAMPLE SIZE, waves and age of the children.


\subsection{Parenting styles items}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Directly fed into the classification exercise.
	\item How often dothe following things occur b/w you and your child?
	\item Likert scales
	\item age-adjusted
	\item single survey-items reduced to measures by taking rowMeans
	\item asked in later waves, individual mean if asked twice
	\item reduces sample size substantially.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interaction behaviors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item play situation, recorded, coded by trained professionals.
	\item scale (in)appropriate
	\item Both parent's and child's behavior rated.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SES}
\subsection{(Non)cognitive skills}
\begin{itemize}
	\item SON-R (quant)
	\item vocab (verbal)
	\item patience: delayed gratification
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Privileged sample
	\item Attrition (check this)
\end{itemize}

Would be great to have attrition summary stats (for the appendix.). SES-variables (means) by waves. Waves on thevertical, variable means horizontally.


How to interpret intrusiveness scale?!
