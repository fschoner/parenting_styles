Data used in this study is drawn from the... check NEPS-Website what to write here (panel, early childhood development, early on, (non) cognitive skill measures). I do not exploit the panel dimension and use it as a cross section. SAMPLE SIZE, waves and age of the children.


\subsection{Parenting styles items}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Directly fed into the classification exercise.
	\item How often dothe following things occur b/w you and your child?
	\item Likert scales
	\item age-adjusted
	\item single survey-items reduced to measures by taking rowMeans
	\item asked in later waves, individual mean if asked twice
	\item reduces sample size substantially.
	\item Point out here which are especially useful for the p.s. classification (see ECMA)
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item POWERFUL ENFORCEMENT directly speaks to how often a child's choice set is restricted.
		
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interaction behaviors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item play situation, recorded, coded by trained professionals.
	\item scale (in)appropriate
	\item Both parent's and child's behavior rated.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SES}
\subsection{(Non)cognitive skills}
\begin{itemize}
	\item SON-R (quant)
	\item vocab (verbal)
	\item patience: delayed gratification
	\item standardized to have mean zero and s.d. 1
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Privileged sample
	\item Attrition (check this)
\end{itemize}

Would be great to have attrition summary stats (for the appendix.). SES-variables (means) by waves. Waves on thevertical, variable means horizontally.


How to interpret intrusiveness scale?!
