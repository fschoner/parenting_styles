\subsection{Empirical Strategy}
The main purpose of this validation exercise is to investigate whether and to what extent differences in the identified parenting styles are associated with differences in (i) the parent-child interaction and (ii) the children's socio-economic environment. Both aspects should be affected by the choice of parenting style since, for example, permissive parents are expected to interefere less with their children's actions. In addition, low-SES parents often spend much less time with their offspring \parencite[e.g.][]{falkSocioEconomicStatusInequalities2021}, a factor that is part of a parenting style. I therefore estimate the following Multinomial Logit model using maximum likelihood \parencite[see][chapter 15]{cameronMicroeconometricsMethodsApplications2005}:
\begin{equation}
	\text{Pr}(Y_i = m) = \frac{\exp(\x^\top_{i} \be_m + \z^\top_{i} \bm{\gamma}_m)}{\sum_{l=1}^{3} \exp(\x^\top_{i}\be_l + \z^\top_{i} \bm{\gamma}_l)}, \qquad m = 1, 2, 3, \label{eq:multinom}
\end{equation}
where the values of $m$ correspond to the parenting styles authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive, respectively and thereby define $Y_i$. $\x_i$ contains individual-level regressors capturing the parental interaction behavior in various dimensions (interviewer rated parental sensitivity, intrusiveness, detachment, stimulation, positive regard, negative regard, and emotionality when dealing their children), while $\z_i$ captures the child's socio-economic environment (mother's age, a dummy indicating that both parents completed upper secondary school, net household income, a dummy indicating whether the parents are married, SES as measured by books at home, the number of siblings when the surveyed child was born, and a measure of time investment).

Albeit parameter estimates cannot be interpreted causally, they help identify the factors that predict the parenting styles identified through the classification. Furthermore, they allow ceteris paribus statements in a correlational sense. If the classification captures relevant differences in parenting styles, we expect to see different parental interaction behaviors across classes. For example, authoritarian parents may be more intrusive than other parents while authoritative parents might be stimulating their children more intensively. Similarly, differences in the socio-economic environment such as family structure could differ across parenting styles. According to \textcite{beckerTreatiseFamily1981}, parents probably spend less time with later-born children than with their first-born child.  

\subsection{Logit estimates}
Coefficient estimates in terms of relative risk ratios (RRRs) from the multinomial logit model in (\ref{eq:multinom}) using the permissive parenting style as a reference category are shown in Table \ref{tab:res}.

Column (1) solely uses parental interaction behaviors (see Table \ref{tab:summ_stats}) to predict parenting styles obtained from the classification exercise, while column (2) adds various variables capturing the childs' socio-economic environment.\footnote{
For the sake of brevity I do not report all coefficient estimates. More specifically, only parental behaviors most obviously related to parenting styles are reported. Second, several variables capturing the socio-economic environment are omitted. See the appendix, table \ref{tab:res_appendix}.
} 
The RRRs for the sensitivity, intrusiveness, and detachment behaviors are smaller than one (albeit often insignificantly) in columns (1) and (2). For example, the first coefficient in column (1) means that more sensitive parents are less likely to fall in the authoritarian class than into the permissive class. Given that we expect authoritarian parents to be more likely to insist on rules and impose their will on their child, their behavior is, by definition, less tuned to the child's needs, i.e. less sensitive. Therefore, this result is in line with the classification.
%
In addition, both specifications indicate that more intrusive parents are more likely to parent in a permissive than authoritative manner. Since permissive parents are expected to be the least interfering with the child's actions, this finding contradicts the classification. Unfortunately, there are no significant associations between parenting styles and parental detachment. Finally, RRRs for parental emotionality suggest that permissive parents are less likely to be the ones showing appropriate emotions during the play scene as compared to authoritarian parents. This neither confirms nor contradicts the classification.

Including controls for the child's socio-economic environment hardly changes coefficients on parental interaction behaviors. At the same time, they reveal important insights themselves. Keeping interaction behaviors constant, parents who spend more time on highly interactive activities with their children are more likely to fall into the authoritative and authoritarian classes. Both effects are large in economic terms too. A one standard deviation increase in time investment is associated with an increase in the relative risk of belonging to the authoritarian class as compared to the permissive class by a factor of 2.332.

Two conclusions emerge from the results. First, estimates on the associations between parenting styles and parental interaction behaviors are only partially in line with ex-ante hypotheses (sensitivity). This matches the pattern from the initial classification exercise well when some of the predictions generated from model were borne out in the data while others were not. Second, the socio-economic environment seems to outperform parental interaction behaviors in terms of predictive power of parenting styles. In particular, the amount of time spent on highly interactive parent-child activities seems to matter much more for the classification of parenting styles than actual parental behavior. This point is vividly illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:density}, which shows that this holds for the entire distribution of time investment.

\begin{figure}[htb]

	\label{fig:density}  
\end{figure} 

This has important ramifications for the classification of parenting styles. Time investment is negatively correlated with the number of children born before the surveyed child ($p < 0.01$), suggesting that the classification is partly driven by a quantity-versus-quality trade-off parents face when deciding about fertility \parencite{beckerTreatiseFamily1981} because the amount of time invested is one example of child quality choice. This finding has two alternative interpretations. First, this can be viewed as evidence that having more children \textit{makes} parents more permissive, just because the cost of their previous parenting style has become prohibitively high as the number of children increases. This implies that parenting style is a function of the number of children in addition to parental preferences and the economic environment. Second, one could argue that the number of children does not change parent's (latent) parenting style. Instead, merely the time each child is exposed to this style decreases in the number of children.
